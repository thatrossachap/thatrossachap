<strong>Hi there!</strong> My name's Ross Anderson, I'm a essayist who writes about politics, culture, and technology, and I like building stuff online.
<br>You can find my work in <em>Los Angeles Magazine</em>, <em>The American Conservative</em>, <em>The Dispatch</em>, and more.
<br>I also was a 2020 <em>Tablet Magazine</em> fellow.
<hr />
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and will be releasing things in the near future.
<br> <em>These are early days though so be patient!</em>

<hr />

In the meantime though:
